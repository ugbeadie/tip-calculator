## How to run the code

* First, on the public repo page, click the 'code' and copy the url under https.
* Open your command line (or git bash) and 'cd' into your desired folder(navigate) where you want to have the folder.
* On your command line, run the 'git clone' command and paste the url copied earlier and click enter.
* When that is done, a folder will be created in your desired directory on your local computer.
* Open the folder with a code editor(i'll use vs code for this), then open your terminal and run 'npm start' to start your development server.
* Ensure you are in the proper directory.
